# Prev
Undestand va_arg, va_copy, va_end, va_start macros: maybe write about it 
Undestand data conversiont to str: maybe write about it
Maybe write about table dispatch in C language
Maybe write about dispatch table 

# Implementation road

[ ] Parsing string, check quantity format specifiers and data
[ ] Handling Edge Cases
[ ] Handling Format Specifiers
[ ] Handling flags
[ ] Printing the string and clean up
